# MultiResUNet for Precise Segmentation of Optic Disc and Blood Vessels in Diabetic Retinopathy

üìå **Overview**

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss, requiring early detection for effective treatment. This project implements MultiResUNet, a deep learning model for the precise segmentation of optic discs and blood vessels from fundus images.

Using MultiResUNet, the model achieves:
- ‚úÖ 98% accuracy in optic disc segmentation
- ‚úÖ 87% accuracy in blood vessel segmentation

This repository contains the model architecture, dataset preprocessing, training scripts, and evaluation metrics for DR segmentation.

üìÇ **Dataset**

The dataset consists of fundus images with their corresponding segmentation masks for:
- Optic Disc (Class 0)
- Blood Vessels (Class 1)

The images and masks are preprocessed and split into training, validation, and testing sets.

üìå **Methodology**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
- Resized images to 512x512
- Applied CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) for better contrast
- Normalized pixel values

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ MultiResUNet Architecture
- Enhanced U-Net with multi-resolution blocks
- Uses residual connections to retain spatial information
- Optimized with Dice Loss & Adam Optimizer

**Model Architecture:**

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Training & Optimization
- 100 epochs with batch size 16
- Learning rate: 0.001 (adaptive with ReduceLROnPlateau)
- Loss function: Dice Coefficient Loss

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation Metrics
- ‚úÖ Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC)
- ‚úÖ Intersection over Union (IoU)
- ‚úÖ Precision & Recall
